takes as its starting point the observation that fuel prices – and thus taxes – are important for good management of climate change and other environmental problems. To economists this should be no surprise yet it seems that the role of fuel taxation as an instrument of climate policy has not been fully appreciated. It is however one of the few policy instruments that, since several decades, has actually reduced fuel consumption appreciably. Thanks to taxation (mainly in Europe and Japan), carbon emissions are considerably lower than they would have been otherwise. In future where carbon emissions are to be cut drastically, this instrument will be crucial. There is however much opposition to the instrument. This opposition uses various arguments, for instance that fuel taxes hurt the poor since they are strongly regressive. We however find that the choice of country and methodology turns out to be of great consequence. We study seven European countries—France, Germany, United Kingdom, Italy, Serbia, Spain and Sweden and do find some evidence of regressivity but the evidence is very weak. It does not apply when lifetime income is used and it does not apply to the poorest country in the group. The best one-line summary is probably that the tax is approximately proportional.},

Interaction effects with mineral oil taxes reduce carbon taxes on motor fuels and transport externalities increase them. We show that the cost-effective overall carbon tax on motor fuels should be lower than the one on thermal fuels. This is found in spite of the fact that pre-existing taxes on motor fuels are well below our estimate of the transport externality per unit of transport fuel consumption. Differentiating taxes in favor of motor fuels yields only slightly more equitable incidence effects among households, suggesting that equity considerations play a minor role when designing differentiated carbon pricing policies.},

	abstract = {Swiss targets for climate policy require significant reductions of emissions by 2050. While such reductions can be achieved in a cost-efficient manner by employing taxes on greenhouse gas emissions, such taxes tend to lead to a regressive distribution of policy cost among households. To counteract such a regressive outcome, tax revenue may be recycled in a progressive way. This paper uses a computable general equilibrium model coupled with a microsimulation of household income and expenditure to examine the policy cost of different carbon tax policies and their distribution across households. I find that in the absence of revenue recycling, emission taxation leads to a regressive distribution of policy cost. I analyze different revenue recycling schemes (per-capita lump-sum transfers, reductions in labor taxation, and reductions in {VAT} taxation of necessary commodities) and their ability to avoid regressive outcomes.},

We develop a numerical multi-country multi-sector general equilibrium model of the {EU}-27 economy which resolves household income deciles, based on micro-survey data on expenditure and income, and markets for fossil fuels, electricity, and ({EU}-wide and national) tradeable emissions rights. We find that carbon price harmonization yields efficiency gains at the {EU} level. The distributional effects between countries vary and depend largely on the redistribution of carbon revenues. Based on the rules currently in place in Phase {IV} of the {EU} {ETS}, efficiency gains flow disproportionately to low-income countries. Within-country incidence is progressive or neutral for most countries when revenue redistribution is ignored, and is not much affected by carbon price harmonization. Per-capita-based revenue redistribution rules lead to strong progressive outcomes and yield gains for low-income households. Evaluating different policy options using a social welfare function that incorporates inequality aversion suggests that there is no trade-off between efficiency and equity in harmonizing carbon prices in the {EU} economy.},

	abstract = {Many policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions have at their core efforts to put a price on carbon emissions. Carbon pricing impacts households both by raising the cost of carbon intensive products and by changing factor prices. A complete analysis requires taking both effects into account. The impact of carbon pricing is determined by heterogeneity in household spending patterns across income groups as well as heterogeneity in factor income patterns across income groups. It is also affected by precise formulation of the policy (how is the revenue from carbon pricing distributed) as well as the treatment of other government policies (e.g. the treatment of transfer payments). What is often neglected in analyses of policy is the heterogeneity of impacts across households even within income or regional groups. In this paper, we incorporate 15,588 households from the U.S. Consumer and Expenditure Survey data as individual agents in a comparative-static general equilibrium framework. These households are represented within the {MIT} {USREP} model, a detailed general equilibrium model of the U.S. economy. In particular, we categorize households by full household income (factor income as well as transfer income) and apply various measures of lifetime income to distinguish households that are temporarily low-income (e.g., retired households drawing down their financial assets) from permanently low-income households. We also provide detailed within-group distributional measures of burden impacts from various policy scenarios.},

However, most studies so far have focused on income, household size and other structural factors while neglecting the potential relevance of attitudinal variables such as environmental concern. Those studies that did examine environmental attitudes were mostly based on "intent-oriented" measures of pro-environmental behavior instead of actual environmental impacts. The present study brings these lines of research together by analyzing the relationship between emissions, income and environmental attitudes within a framework of multivariate analysis. Furthermore, three specific emissions domains – mobility, housing and food – are analyzed separately and the results are compared to those based on a scale of pro-environmental behavior. All analyses are based on data from a large representative general population survey, the Swiss Environmental Survey 2007 (n = 3369), and a subsequent life cycle analysis. The results clearly indicate that next to income, environmental concern is an important predictor of emissions, even when controlling for the effects of income.},

A set of harmonized representative {CO}2 taxes and tax revenue recycling schemes is implemented in five large-scale economy-wide general equilibrium models. Recycling schemes include various combinations of uniform transfers to households and labor and capital income tax reductions. Particular focus is put on equity — the distribution of impacts across household incomes — and efficiency, evaluated in terms of household welfare. Despite important differences in the assumptions underlying the models, we find general agreement regarding the ranking of recycling schemes in terms of both efficiency and equity. All models identify a clear trade-off between efficient but regressive capital tax reductions and progressive but costly uniform transfers to households; all agree upon the inferiority of labor tax reductions in terms of welfare efficiency; and all agree that different combinations of capital tax reductions and household transfers can be used to balance efficiency and distributional concerns. A subset of the models go further and find that equity concerns, particularly regarding the impact of the tax on low income households, can be alleviated without sacrificing much of the double-dividend benefits offered by capital tax rebates. There is, however, less agreement regarding the progressivity of {CO}2 taxation net of revenue recycling. Regionally, the models agree that abatement and welfare impacts will vary considerably across regions of the U.S. and generally agree on their broad geographical distribution. There is, however, little agreement regarding the regions which would profit more from the various recycling schemes.},

Nevertheless, the geographical and sectoral coverage of substantial carbon pricing remains low, often due to concerns about increasing economic inequality. Regulations such as fuel economy standards are more popular. Could the reason be that they have an equity advantage over carbon pricing? We develop two models, one representing energy services and the other the carbon-intensity of consumption, to identify the economic situations in which this is the case. First, we prove that an efficiency standard can be more equitable than carbon pricing when consumers prefer high-carbon technology attributes. Evidence from the {US} vehicle market confirms this finding. Second, we show theoretically, and through a numerical application to the Chinese transport sector, that intensity standards are preferable when richer households consume a greater share of high-emissions goods. Our results hold when the redistribution of carbon pricing revenue is not progressive. These insights may help advance decarbonisation when pricing instruments remain unpopular.},

Economic growth offsets efficiency gains, while strategies for energy sufficiency are usually not seriously considered. Action toward a more sustainable society, for example, a 2000 W- and 1 ton {CO}2-society, must be taken by individuals but further incentives must be set. In order to provide individuals with detailed information about their mitigation options, we took the results from a survey of environmental behavior of 3369 Swiss Citizens, and combined them with life cycle assessment. Our results from this bottom-up approach show a huge bandwidth of the ecological footprints among the individuals interviewed.

This allowed us to evaluate the direct influence of consumer behavior on national greenhouse gas emissions using a consumption-based approach and the quantification of the range of these emissions from different lifestyles. We conclude that the consumer has a direct influence on slightly more than 50\% of the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the Domestic Material Consumption.

Here, households residing in relatively dense urban neighborhoods with good access to transit and traveling relatively few miles in private vehicles (roughly 10\% of the U.S. population) are considered candidates for carsharing. This analysis recognizes cradle-to-grave impacts of carsharing on vehicle ownership levels, travel distances, fleet fuel economy (partly due to faster turnover), parking demand (and associated infrastructure), and alternative modes. Results suggest that current carsharing members reduce their average individual transportation energy use and {GHG} emissions by approximately 51\% upon joining a carsharing organization. Collectively, these individual-level effects translate to roughly 5\% savings in all household transport-related energy use and {GHG} emissions in the U.S. These energy and emissions savings can be primarily attributed to mode shifts and avoided travel, followed by savings in parking infrastructure demands and fuel consumption. When indirect rebound effects are accounted for (assuming travel-cost savings is then spent on other goods and services), net savings are expected to be 3\% across all U.S. households.},

	abstract = {Household consumption, apart from governmental consumption, is the main driver of worldwide economy. Attached to each household purchase are economic activities along the preceding supply chain, with the associated resource use and emissions. A method to capture and assess all these resource uses and emissions is life cycle assessment. We developed a model for the life cycle assessment of housing and land-based mobility (excluding air travel) consumption of individual households a small village in Switzerland. Statistical census and dwelling register data are the foundations of the model. In a case study performed on a midsized community, we found a median value of greenhouse gas emissions of 3.12 t {CO}2 equiv and a mean value of 4.30 t {CO}2 equiv per capita and year for housing and mobility. Twenty-one percent of the households in the investigated region were responsible for 50\% of the total greenhouse gas emissions, meaning that if their emissions could be halved the total emissions of the community would be reduced by 25\%. Furthermore, a cluster analysis revealed that driving factors for large environmental footprints are demands of large living area heated by fossil energy carriers, as well as large demands of motorized private transportation.},

	abstract = {Household consumption is a main driver of economy and might be regarded as ultimately responsible for environmental impacts occurring over the life cycle of products and services. Given that purchase decisions are made on household levels and are highly behavior-driven, the derivation of targeted environmental measures requires an understanding of household behavior patterns and the resulting environmental impacts. To provide an appropriate basis in support of effective environmental policymaking, we propose a new approach to capture the variability of lifestyle-induced environmental impacts. Lifestyle-archetypes representing prevailing consumption patterns are derived in a two-tiered clustering that applies a Ward-clustering on top of a preconditioning self-organizing map. The environmental impacts associated with specific archetypical behavior are then assessed in a hybrid life cycle assessment framework. The application of this approach to the Swiss Household Budget Survey reveals a global picture of consumption that is in line with previous studies, but also demonstrates that different archetypes can be found within similar socio-economic household types. The appearance of archetypes diverging from general macro-trends indicates that the proposed approach might be useful for an enhanced understanding of consumption patterns and for the future support of policymakers in devising effective environmental measures targeting specific consumer groups.},

In the domestic sector, this could, for example, be achieved by improving space heating efficiency and thus decreasing heating expenditure. However, in order to efficiently design and implement such policy measures, a better understanding of the determinants affecting heating expenditure is needed. In this paper we examine the following determinants: socio-economic factors, building characteristics, heating technologies and weather conditions. In contrast to most other studies we use panel data to investigate household demand for heating in Great Britain. Our data sample is the result of an annual set of interviews with more than 5000 households, starting in 1991 and ending in 2005. The sample represents a total of 64,000 observations over the fifteen-year period. Our aim is to derive price and income elasticities both for Britain as a whole and for different types of household. Our results suggest that differences exist between owner-occupied and renter households. These households react differently to changes in income and prices. Our results also imply that a number of socio-economic criteria have a significant influence on heating expenditure, independently of the fuel used for heating. Understanding the impacts of different factors on heating expenditure and impact differences between types of household is helpful in designing target-oriented policy measures.},

A number of socio-economic characteristics of households are included along with building characteristics. Our analysis covers information on more than 12,000 households in Germany for the years 1998 and 2003. The analysis continues by investigating whether different kinds of households are affected differently by increases in energy prices. Households in owner-occupied properties are less affected compared to those in rented accommodation, this could be because owners are more likely to have installed energy-efficient heating and hot water supply systems and landlords have less of an incentive to improve the conditions of their rented accommodations. An energy policy targeting especially the latter group might benefit not only households in rented accommodation, but might also increase energy-efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well.},

In this paper, we investigate the severity of this split-incentive problem in thermal efficiency investments in the German housing market, where the share of renters is among the highest in the European Union and the majority of rented apartments is owned by private individuals. Using data on energy performance scores from Germany's largest online housing market platform between 2019 and 2021, we find economically small differences in the energy efficiency levels between apartments that are offered for sale for own use compared to those that are rented out on the housing market. These findings suggest that there may not be a critical energy efficiency deficit due to the high share of renters in the multi apartment building sector.},

Results show that informing tenants of a {CHF} 1 decrease in energy bills leads to {CHF} 1.12 in acceptable rent increase on average. Quantile regressions further indicate that the average treatment effect of information reflects heterogeneous changes along the entire distribution of acceptable rent increases. By contrast, information on energy bills variability dampens acceptable rent increase, and information about {CO}2 tax payments has no incremental impact on choices. Our results highlight the importance of credible ex-ante estimates of financial savings associated with energy efficiency investments.},

The objective of this study is twofold. First, I aim to provide initial empirical evidence of the extent to which split incentives between landlords and tenants may lead to underinvestment. Second, I investigate the influence of tax credits and energy burdens on energy efficiency expenditures. Given the complexity of studying the decision to invest in energy-saving renovations, I use a bivariate Tobit model to compare decisions about energy-efficient works and repair works, even when the renovation expenditures seem quite similar. The analysis shows that tenants are doubly penalized: they have high energy expenditures due to energy-inefficient building characteristics, and because they are poorer than homeowners, they are unable to invest in energy-saving systems. The results also confirm that tax credits are ineffective in the split incentives context. In terms of public policy, the government should focus on low-income tenants, and mandatory measures such as minimum standards seem appropriate. Financial support from a third-party financer also might be a solution.},

	abstract = {A growing body of research has highlighted the major contribution of aviation non-{CO}2 emissions and effects to anthropogenic climate change. Regulation of these emissions, for example in the {EU} Emissions Trading System, requires the use of a climate metric. However, choosing a suitable climate metric is challenging due to the high uncertainties of aviation non-{CO}2 climate impacts, their variability in atmospheric lifetimes and their dependence on emission location and altitude. Here we use {AirClim} to explore alternatives to the conventional Global Warming Potential ({GWP}) by analysing the neutrality, temporal stability, compatibility and simplicity of existing climate metrics and perform a trade-off. We find that using the temperature-based Average Temperature Response ({ATR}) or using an Efficacy-weighted {GWP} ({EGWP}) would enable a more accurate assessment of existing as well as future aircraft powered by novel aviation fuels.},

	abstract = {Hydrothermal carbonization ({HTC}) has recently emerged as a promising technology for converting diverse forms of waste with a high moisture content into value-added products such as biofuel, biochar, and activated carbon. With an increasing demand for sustainable and carbon-neutral energy sources, {HTC} has attracted considerable attention in the literature. However, a successful transition from laboratory-scale to large-scale industrial applications entails notable challenges. This review critically assesses the upscaling of hydrothermal carbonization processes, emphasizing the challenges, innovations, and environmental implications associated with this transition. The challenges inherent in upscaling {HTC} are comprehensively discussed, including aspects such as reactor design, process optimization, and the current treatment technology for process water. This review presents recent innovations and technological advancements that address these challenges and explores integrated solutions to enhancing hydrothermal carbonization’s scalability. Additionally, this review highlights key companies that have developed and implemented {HTC} plants for commercial purposes.

	abstract = {Emissions of aviation include {CO}2, H2O, {NOx}, sulfur oxides, and soot. Many studies have investigated the annual mean climate impact of aviation emissions. While {CO}2 has a long atmospheric residence time and is almost uniformly distributed in the atmosphere, non-{CO}2 gases and particles and their products have short atmospheric residence times and are heterogeneously distributed. The climate impact of non-{CO}2 aviation emissions is known to vary with different meteorological background situations. The aim of this study is to systematically investigate the influence of characteristic weather situations on aviation climate effects over the North Atlantic region, to identify the most sensitive areas, and to potentially detect systematic weather-related similarities. If aircraft were re-routed to avoid climate-sensitive regions, the overall aviation climate impact might be reduced. Hence, the sensitivity of the atmosphere to local emissions provides a basis for the assessment of weather-related, climate-optimized flight trajectory planning. To determine the climate change contribution of an individual emission as a function of location, time, and weather situation, the radiative impact of local emissions of {NOx} and H2O to changes in O3, {CH}4, H2O and contrail cirrus was computed by means of the {ECHAM}5/{MESSy} Atmospheric Chemistry model. From this, 4-dimensional climate change functions ({CCFs}) were derived. Typical weather situations in the North Atlantic region were considered for winter and summer. Weather-related differences in O3, {CH}4, H2O, and contrail cirrus {CCFs} were investigated. The following characteristics were identified: enhanced climate impact of contrail cirrus was detected for emissions in areas with large-scale lifting, whereas low climate impact of contrail cirrus was found in the area of the jet stream. Northwards of 60∘ N, contrails usually cause climate warming in winter, independent of the weather situation. {NOx} emissions cause a high positive climate impact if released in the area of the jet stream or in high-pressure ridges, which induces a south- and downward transport of the emitted species, whereas {NOx} emissions at, or transported towards, high latitudes cause low or even negative climate impact. Independent of the weather situation, total {NOx} effects show a minimum at ∼250 {hPa}, increasing towards higher and lower altitudes, with generally higher positive impact in summer than in winter. H2O emissions induce a high climate impact when released in regions with lower tropopause height, whereas low climate impact occurs for emissions in areas with higher tropopause height. H2O {CCFs} generally increase with height and are larger in winter than in summer. The {CCFs} of all individual species can be combined, facilitating the assessment of total climate impact of aircraft trajectories considering {CO}2 and spatially and temporally varying non-{CO}2 effects. Furthermore, they allow for the optimization of aircraft trajectories with reduced overall climate impact. This also facilitates a fair evaluation of trade-offs between individual species. In most regions, {NOx} and contrail cirrus dominate the sensitivity to local aviation emissions. The findings of this study recommend considering weather-related differences for flight trajectory optimization in favour of reducing total climate impact.},

	abstract = {This paper explores how to recycle carbon tax revenue back to households to maximize welfare. Using a general equilibrium lifecycle model calibrated to reflect the heterogeneity in the U.S. economy, we find that the welfare maximizing rebate uses two thirds of carbon-tax revenue to reduce the distortionary tax on capital income while using the remaining one third to increase the progressivity of the labor-income tax. This recycling approach attains higher welfare and more equality than the lump-sum rebate approach preferred by policymakers as well as the approach originally prescribed by economists – which called exclusively for reductions in distortionary taxes. Importantly, we find that recycling a majority of the revenue by lowering the capital tax is unique to raising revenue through a carbon tax.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the distributional effects of France's recently introduced carbon tax. Using a microsimulation model built on a representative sample of the French population from 2012, it simulates the taxes levied on each household's consumption of energy for housing and transport. Without revenue recycling, the carbon tax is regressive and increases fuel poverty. From a policy perspective, this finding indicates that the question of fuel poverty cannot be ignored in the quest for a fair ecological transition. It proposes that some of the revenues from the carbon tax should be redistributed to households. Different designs of cash transfer to support households are then compared. The results show that the inequities of the carbon tax could be offset at reasonable cost relative to total carbon tax revenues. However, adjusting the design of cash transfers to criteria other than income level does not diminish the cost of compensating households. The benefits of finely adjusting cash transfers may therefore be somewhat limited. Most notably, the results show that targeting revenue recycling at low-income households would help to reduce fuel poverty substantially. This study therefore indicates that carbon taxation actually provides an opportunity to finance ambitious policies to fight fuel poverty.},

Carbon pricing can play a key role in meeting this objective. A cap-and-permit system, or alternatively a carbon tax indexed to a fixed emission-reduction trajectory, not only can spur cost-effective mitigation and cost-reducing innovation, but also, crucially, can ensure that emissions are held to the target level. The carbon prices needed to meet this constraint are likely to be considerably higher, however, than existing prices and conventional measures of the social cost of carbon. This poses issues of distributional equity and political sustainability that can be addressed by universal dividends funded by carbon revenues.},
