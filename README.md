Withpydoit installed (see ./requirements.txt), running the command 'doit'in the root folder of this repository will execute the differentstages of the buildstream as needed.  The file dodo.py contains theinformation for pydoit about the project's interdependencies and inwhat sequence different commands need to ber run.Note: The execution of the analysis requires confidential data fromthe Swiss Federal Statistical Office (FSO).
